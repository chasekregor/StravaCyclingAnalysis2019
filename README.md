## Project Description
I have been using [Strava](www.strava.com) to house all of my cycling data since 2013. Using the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/), Python, Altair, and Jupyter notebooks, I extracted and analyzed my cycling data from 2019. In doing so, I answered the following questions: 
 - What percentage of days in 2019 did I ride?
 - How many miles did I ride throughout the year?
 - How many hours did I ride throughout the year?
 - What were the number of rides by 30 minute durations?
 - What were the number of rides by distances?
 - What was my variation in wattage like?
 - What was my variation in heart rate like?
 - On average, how many hours did I ride per day of the week?
 - Can I find any correlations between my different cycling data points?
 - etc.
 


## Getting Started
